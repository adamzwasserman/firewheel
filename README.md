# FireWheel

We live in a Post GDPR-mageddon; Fire and Wheel bring light and rainbows to the previously soul-crushing work of redacting Personal Identifiable Information (PII) commonly found in log files, and other unstructured text. Yeah. I'm looking at YOU, Splunk. To whit, we have invented Fire, and The Wheel.

FIRE! Are you worried about being sued for Billions of â‚¬uros under GDPR? Ya got email addresses in a logfile? We feel ya. Who doesn't? Kill 'em with FIRE.

WHEEL is vapourware. Now that we've cleared that up, this what it is gonna do: WHEEL will run over stuff like civic addresses and birthdays, leaving a clean conscience in its wake.

## Fire Features
- FIRE is gentle. It doesn't change the structure or content of a file other than redacting email addresses
- FIRE is robust. It has been tested extensively against massive datasets.
- FIRE is smart. It is clever enough to ignore image files (png and jpg) with a naming convention that resembles an email `e.g. imagefile@2x.png`


## Requirements
You must have Python 3.6 or higher. If not, you do not get into the club.

You will need the following (MIT licensed) 3rd party python modules:
 - The excellent `arrow` for better time handling than the built-in python modules
 - The equally excellent `tqdm` for totally awesome progress bars

## Caveats
Any email using the following [RFC 5322](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322) legal email characters/formats will NOT be anonymized by FireWheel.

- Consecutive quoted dots `e.g. John..Doe@example.com is not allowed but "John..Doe"@example.com is allowed`

- space and ` " ( ) , : ; < > @ [ \ ] ` characters inside a quoted-string (RFC 5322 3.2.4)

- email addresses with a backslash or double-quote preceded by a backslash

- email addresses with comments in parentheses at either end of the local-part; `e.g. john.smith(comment)@example.com and (comment)john.smith@example.com are both equivalent to john.smith@example.com`

- email addresses that contain the following characters, which are more commonly found in URLs as delimiters than in email addresses: `& ; / " < > ? $ =`. Please see table below that illustrates collisions between possible (legal) email address characters and possible URL delimiters (both official, and non-offical, but commonly used).

## In Summary:
FireWheel *will* find emaill addresses that use any alphanumeric character as well as the `backtick` or any one of the following characters in the local-part: `! # $ % ' * + - ^ _{ | } ~ .` followed by `@` or `%40`, followed by a legal hostname.

It *will not* find (and anonymize) email addresses that contain any other characters. It *wil* change `%40` to `@`. It *will not* convert any urlencoded text other than `%40`.
